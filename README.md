# hello-world
this is my first respiratory...anyways...just testing :)
my name  is starstrikez3 and im new here 
i wanted to join  because i am interested in some things:
learning some things about about this site because i've used it to help me hack my old 3DS XL awhile ago
and am going to use it for installing ntrboot, boot9strap, Luma3DS, and other CFWs on my New 3DS XL
another thing is to get involved with something socially and maybe even some hands-on projects over the web
also I would like to learn more about hacking and programming because its one of the things that might help me in my future job :)
